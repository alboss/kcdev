Adding your own HTML/Jade page
------------------------
Jade is a template engine that compiles to HTML. It's not a requirement to use Jade, however the grunt commands were created to compile Jade files. [Learn more about Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)

If you want to add a Jade file, add it to the `/src/jade` folder and then run `grunt html`. 

Otherwise you can complie the base Jade files with the `grunt development` command and then duplicate and modify one of the theme files in the public folder. 

Adding your own test JavaScript
---------------------------
If you not using Jade, you can insert your JavaScript code inline or place it in the `public > js` folder. If you are using Jade, you can add your code to the block named `custom-js`. It's at the bottom of the page. Make sure to indent two spaces under the `script.` tag. When you are done run the `grunt html` command. 
`````````````````````````````
block custom-js
  <!-- Custom JS -->
  script.
    function myCode(){

    }
```````````````

Adding your own test CSS
---------------------------
If you not using Jade, you can insert your CSS code inline or place it in the `public > css` folder. If you are using Jade, you can add your css to the block named custom-style. It's at the top of the page. Make sure to indent your two spaces under the `style.` tag.  When you are done run the `grunt html` command. 
`````````````````````````````
block custom-style
  <!-- Custom CSS -->
  style.
    #myCss {

  }
```````````````
